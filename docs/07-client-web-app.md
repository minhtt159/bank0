# bank0 — Client Web App (PWA, Cloudflare Workers)

> A **lightweight, mobile-first PWA** (TypeScript / Preact + Vite, ~15 KB gzip)
> hosted on a **Cloudflare Worker** at `bank0.hnimn.art`, over the client API at
> `api.bank0.hnimn.art` ([`06-client-api.md`](06-client-api.md)). Auth (JWT +
> refresh, with MFA/step-up as a designed extension) lives in
> [`06-client-api.md`](06-client-api.md). Source: `web/app/` (SPA) and `worker/`
> (Worker).

## 1. Scope

Six customer flows:

1. Login with `username:password` → JWT (SSO/MFA covered in §9).
2. View own details, accounts, statements.
3. Homepage = the user's accounts as a vertical scroll list.
4. Create a transaction (transfer).
5. Transfer card: **fuzzy-pick the source account**, **fuzzy-pick the destination**
   (from **saved beneficiaries**); a read-only **fraud preflight** (`/transfers/intent`)
   may add a warning card + acknowledgement + cooling-off before Send.
6. On success, show transfer details → back to homepage. A gated payment may land
   `held` (customer confirms or cancels from the receipt) or `under_review`
   (operator decides; no customer action).

**Principles inherited** ([`01-overview.md`](01-overview.md)): the API stays thin, the
ledger/DB stays the source of truth, ownership is scoped to the JWT subject. The web app
adds **no business logic** — it's a presentation layer over the client API.

## 2. Architecture — Worker as static host + same-origin proxy

```mermaid
graph LR
    B[Mobile browser<br/>SPA / PWA] -->|same-origin HTTPS| W
    subgraph CF[Cloudflare Worker · bank0.hnimn.art]
      W[Worker]
      A[(Static assets<br/>index.html, JS, CSS, SW)]
      W --- A
    end
    W -->|proxy /api/* + Bearer| API[client API<br/>api.bank0.hnimn.art]
    API --> PG[(Postgres · ownership-scoped)]
```

The Worker does two jobs:

- **Serve the built SPA** (Workers Static Assets) — `index.html` + hashed JS/CSS +
  `manifest.webmanifest` + service worker.
- **Proxy `/api/*` → `https://api.bank0.hnimn.art/*`**, stripping the `/api` prefix and
  forwarding the `Authorization` header.

**Why proxy instead of calling `api.*` directly:** the browser only ever talks to its own
origin (`bank0.hnimn.art`), so there is **no CORS** and **no backend change** to the api
surface. It also positions the Worker as the future **BFF**
([`06-client-api.md`](06-client-api.md) §6.3): refresh tokens already exist, so the Worker can
later hold the refresh token in an `httpOnly; Secure; SameSite=Strict` cookie and inject the
access token server-side, keeping tokens out of browser JS — **without changing the SPA**.

**Token handling:** the access token (15m TTL) lives in the SPA in memory + a
`sessionStorage` mirror (survives reload, cleared on tab close). The Worker forwards it as
`Authorization: Bearer …`. The httpOnly-cookie BFF upgrade is a Worker-only change that
doesn't touch the SPA.

## 3. The client API behind these flows

Full reference: [`06-client-api.md`](06-client-api.md). The flows map onto these
endpoints.

### 3.1 Reused as-is — `api/openapi.yaml`, `tags:[client]`

| Flow | Endpoint |
|------|----------|
| 1 Login | `POST /auth/login` → `{user_id, token, token_type, expires_at}` (HS256 JWT) |
| 2/3 Accounts | `GET /users/{id}/accounts` → `[Account]` (ownership-scoped to `sub`) |
| 2/3 Account + balance | `GET /accounts/{id}` → `Account` |
| 2/3 Statement | `GET /accounts/{id}/ledger?cursor&limit` → `[LedgerEntry]` (cursor-paginated, running balance, counterparty) |
| 4 Preflight | `POST /transfers/intent` → `TransferIntent` (decision + warning copy; read-only, no idempotency key) |
| 4 Warning ack | `POST /me/warning-acks` (evidence row the submit-time gate checks) |
| 4 Create transfer | `POST /transfers` (+`Idempotency-Key` header) → `TransferResult` |
| 6 Transfer detail | `GET /transfers/{id}` → `Transfer` (incl. `hold_reason`/`hold_expires_at`) |
| 6 Release held | `POST /transfers/{id}/confirm` → posts a `held` transfer (owner only) |
| 6 Cancel held | `POST /transfers/{id}/cancel` → cancels `pending`/`held` (refuses `under_review`) |

### 3.2 Backend endpoints behind these flows

Both are **client-tagged**, ownership-scoped to the JWT `sub` (the `clientSubject`
pattern used by `getAccount`/`listUserAccounts`), generated into `genclient`.
They observe the **shared-op `Params` constraint**
([`04-deployment.md`](04-deployment.md) §4): being **client-only**, they may carry
query/body params without colliding with the admin package.

**(a) `GET /me` — own profile** (Flow 2)
- Returns the caller's own `User` (`full_name`, `email`, `phone_number`, `role`, `status`)
  resolved from `sub`. No dedicated table — reuses the users read, scoped to the subject.
- Spec: `tags:[client]` op `getMe`, reusing the `User` schema.
- Handler: `internal/api/handlers_users.go`, a thin call to the user-by-id query with
  `id := clientSubject(r)`.

**(b) Saved beneficiaries** (Flow 5) — DB-first per [`01`](01-overview.md)

- **Schema** ([`00011_beneficiaries.sql`](../db/migrations/00011_beneficiaries.sql)):
  ```sql
  CREATE TABLE beneficiaries (
      id                 UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT uuidv7(),
      owner_user_id      UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
      label              TEXT NOT NULL,                 -- "Mum", "Landlord"
      credit_account_id  UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES accounts(id),
      iban               TEXT NOT NULL,                 -- denormalized for display/search
      owner_name_masked  TEXT,                          -- e.g. "J*** D**" from resolve
      created_at         TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT now(),
      UNIQUE (owner_user_id, credit_account_id)
  );
  CREATE INDEX idx_beneficiaries_owner ON beneficiaries (owner_user_id);
  ```
- **DB functions** (PL/pgSQL, errors via `mapDBError`):
  - `resolve_account_by_iban(p_iban) → (account_id, owner_name_masked)` — looks up an
    **active** account by IBAN, returns the id + a **masked** owner name (never the full
    PII or balance). `RAISE` (404-mapped) if not found/closed.
  - `add_beneficiary(p_owner, p_label, p_iban) → id` — resolves the IBAN, stores the row;
    rejects self-IBAN and duplicates.
  - `list_beneficiaries(p_owner) → [...]`, `delete_beneficiary(p_owner, p_id)` — both scoped.
- **Endpoints** (`tags:[client]`):
  | Method | Path | Purpose |
  |---|---|---|
  | GET | `/beneficiaries` | list saved payees (fuzzy is **client-side**) |
  | POST | `/beneficiaries` | add by IBAN+label → resolves, stores |
  | DELETE | `/beneficiaries/{id}` | remove |
  | GET | `/beneficiaries/resolve?iban=` | preview an IBAN before saving (masked owner) |
- **Transfer is unchanged:** the SPA sends `credit_account = beneficiary.credit_account_id`
  to `POST /transfers`. Beneficiaries are purely a **lookup/directory**;
  `createTransfer` still enforces that the **debit** account belongs to the caller.
- **Queries:** `db/queries/beneficiaries.sql` (sqlc).

> **Privacy note:** IBAN resolution exposes that an account exists + a masked owner name —
> standard for "confirmation of payee". No balances, no full PII. Rate-limit
> `/beneficiaries/resolve` per subject (enumeration guard).

## 4. Frontend stack (lightweight, mobile-first, PWA)

| Concern | Choice | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Framework | **Preact + TypeScript** | ~4 KB runtime, React-compatible DX, tiny bundle for mobile. |
| Build | **Vite** | Fast, first-class Cloudflare/Workers + `vite-plugin-pwa` support. |
| Router | **`preact-iso`** (or `wouter`) | Hash/history routing in ~1 KB; no heavy router. |
| State | Signals / context | No Redux; auth token + accounts cache in a small store. |
| Data | `fetch` wrapper → `/api/*` | Adds `Authorization`, generates `Idempotency-Key`, maps errors. |
| Fuzzy search | **Fuse.js** (~5 KB) or a hand-rolled scorer | Flows 5 source/destination pick; lists are small (own accounts + saved payees) so it runs entirely client-side. |
| Styling | Hand-written CSS, mobile-first, CSS variables; system font stack | No UI framework; keeps the bundle tiny and the look native-feeling. |
| PWA | `vite-plugin-pwa` → `manifest.webmanifest` + service worker | Installable, app-icon, offline shell. **Network-first** for `/api/*` (never cache money data); precache only the app shell. |
| Money formatting | `Intl.NumberFormat` over **minor units** | API returns `*_minor` int64; format = `value/100` with the account `currency`. |

**Hard rules for a banking PWA:** never cache API responses containing balances/transfers in
the service worker; the SW caches **only** the static shell. Always send a fresh
`Idempotency-Key` (UUID v4) per *user-initiated* transfer attempt, and **reuse the same key on
retry** of that same attempt so a flaky network can't double-post.

---

## 5. Screens & flow mapping

```
/login        →  username/password form           → POST /auth/login, store token+user_id
/             →  Accounts home (vertical scroll)   → GET /users/{id}/accounts        [Flow 3]
/accounts/:id →  Account detail + statement        → GET /accounts/:id, GET .../ledger (infinite scroll via cursor) [Flow 2/3]
/profile      →  My details                        → GET /me                          [Flow 2]
/transfer     →  Transfer card                     → fuzzy source (accounts) + fuzzy dest (beneficiaries) [Flow 4/5]
                 + "add payee" → GET /beneficiaries/resolve?iban= → POST /beneficiaries
                 confirm step → POST /transfers/intent (preflight; warning card / ack / cooling-off)
                 submit → POST /transfers (Idempotency-Key)
/transfer/:id →  Result / receipt                  → GET /transfers/:id → "Back to home" [Flow 6]
```

Details per flow:

1. **Login.** Single card; on 200 store `{token, user_id, expires_at}`; redirect to `/`.
   401 → inline error. A 401 from any later call (token expired) → bounce to `/login`.
2. **Profile + statements.** `/profile` shows `GET /me`. Statements are the `ledger` view:
   each `LedgerEntry` already carries `direction`, `signed_amount`, `balance_after`,
   `counterparty_iban/owner`, `description` — render as a running list; **infinite-scroll**
   by passing the last row's `posted_at` as the next `cursor`.
3. **Home = accounts.** Vertical list of cards (IBAN, kind, `available_minor` prominent,
   `balance_minor` secondary, status badge if not `active`). Tap → `/accounts/:id`. Pull-to-refresh.
4. **Create transaction.** FAB / "Send" → `/transfer`.
5. **Transfer card.**
   - **Source:** fuzzy filter over the user's own accounts (already loaded). Default =
     `is_default` account.
   - **Destination:** fuzzy filter over `GET /beneficiaries`. Inline "**+ Add payee**":
     enter IBAN → `GET /beneficiaries/resolve` shows the masked owner for confirmation →
     `POST /beneficiaries` → it appears in the list, selected.
   - Amount input in major units → convert to `amount_minor`. Client-side guard against
     `amount_minor > available_minor`. Confirm step.
   - **Fraud preflight (Rec 22).** Entering the confirm step fires `POST /transfers/intent`
     (advisory — a failed call never blocks). A returned warning renders as a severity-styled
     card (colored border **plus** a text tag, never color-only; `role="alert"` for critical).
     `decision:"block"` hides Send with plain-language guidance. `required_ack` adds an
     "I understand the risk" checkbox: ticking it POSTs `/me/warning-acks` (category from the
     warning, payee IBAN, exact amount) and starts a `cooling_off_seconds` countdown
     (mm:ss on the Send button, `aria-live` polite) — Send enables at zero. `decision:"review"`
     shows info copy that the payment will be held after sending.
   - Submit `POST /transfers` with a UUID `Idempotency-Key` (held for the duration of the
     attempt so retries dedupe). Submit-time `409 ack_required` / `422 payment_blocked`
     re-render the same warning UI (re-fetching the preflight for real copy), not a raw error.
6. **Receipt.** On success use `transfer_id` → `GET /transfers/:id`; show status, amount,
   parties, `posted_at`. If `status=pending` (deferred settlement / maker-checker), say so.
   `status=held` (risk cooling-off): explain the hold, show `hold_expires_at`
   ("confirm before … or it will be canceled"), with **Confirm and send**
   (`POST /transfers/:id/confirm`) and **Cancel payment** buttons. `status=under_review`
   (screening): "being reviewed by the bank, no action needed, decision by
   `hold_expires_at`" — no customer actions. "Back to home" → `/` (refetch accounts
   so the new balance shows).

---

## 6. Repo layout & build

```
web/app/                     # the customer SPA (sibling of web/template/, the portal UI)
  index.html                 # public/icon.svg
  src/
    main.tsx  app.tsx        # render + router/guard/shell (preact-iso)
    api/client.ts            # fetch wrapper: base /api, Bearer, Idempotency-Key, 401 refresh, error map
    api/types.ts             # hand-kept mirror of the openapi client schemas
    store/auth.ts            # @preact/signals: token + refresh token (sessionStorage)
    routes/{Login,Home,Account,Profile,Transfer,Receipt}.tsx
    lib/{money.ts,fuzzy.ts}  styles.css
  vite.config.ts             # @preact/preset-vite + vite-plugin-pwa; dev proxy /api -> :8090
worker/
  index.ts                   # static-asset serving + /api/* proxy to api.bank0.hnimn.art
  wrangler.toml              # route bank0.hnimn.art/*, [assets] binding, API_ORIGIN var
```

- **Type safety:** `src/api/types.ts` is a hand-kept mirror of the client schemas
  (generatable with `openapi-typescript` to track the contract like the Go side).
- **Tooling:** `task webapp:dev` (Vite + `/api` proxy), `task webapp:build`
  (`tsc --noEmit` + Vite + PWA), `task webapp:deploy` (build + `wrangler deploy`).

---

## 7. Cloudflare Worker

`worker/wrangler.toml` (the route is a top-level key — it must precede any `[table]`,
or TOML folds it into `[vars]`):

```toml
name = "bank0-webapp"
main = "index.ts"
compatibility_date = "2026-01-01"
routes = [{ pattern = "bank0.hnimn.art/*", zone_name = "hnimn.art" }]

[assets]
directory = "../web/app/dist"
binding = "ASSETS"
not_found_handling = "single-page-application"

[vars]
API_ORIGIN = "https://api.bank0.hnimn.art"
```

Worker logic (`worker/index.ts`):
- `GET /api/*` (and other methods): rewrite path (drop `/api`), `fetch(API_ORIGIN + rest)`,
  pass through `Authorization`, `Idempotency-Key`, body, method; return the upstream response.
- Everything else: serve from `ASSETS`; **SPA fallback** → `index.html` for unknown paths so
  client routes deep-link.
- Security headers on HTML: `Content-Security-Policy` (default-src self; connect-src self),
  `Strict-Transport-Security`, `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`, `Referrer-Policy`.
- (Later/BFF) terminate refresh-token cookies here; never expose the refresh token to JS.

---

## 8. Idempotency, errors, money — cross-cutting rules

- **Idempotency-Key** is **required** by `POST /transfers`. Generate `crypto.randomUUID()`
  when the user taps "Confirm"; keep it pinned to that attempt and resend it on retry. A new
  attempt (user edits and resubmits) gets a new key.
- **Error mapping:** the API returns `{error, message}`. Map `401`→re-login,
  `403`→permission/ownership (or `step_up_required` → OTP step-up), `404`→not found,
  `409 ack_required`→warning card + ack + cooling-off (not a raw banner),
  `422 payment_blocked`→blocking warning card, other `422`→business rule
  (insufficient funds, limit, frozen) shown inline, `429`→back off.
- **Money:** all amounts are **int64 minor units**; never use floats. Display with
  `Intl.NumberFormat(locale, {style:'currency', currency})` on `minor/100`.

---

## 9. Auth lifecycle & SSO

**Current:** username/password → `POST /auth/login` → short (15m) HS256 access token
**+ refresh token**. The SPA refreshes transparently on a 401 (single-flight; the same
`Idempotency-Key` rides the retry so a transfer can't double-post) and revokes server-side on
sign-out. Full design in [`06-client-api.md`](06-client-api.md) §3.

**Designed extensions ([`06-client-api.md`](06-client-api.md) §6):**
- **Move refresh to the Worker/BFF** — hold the refresh token in an `httpOnly` cookie so the SPA
  only ever sees a short-lived access token in memory. SPA code is unaffected.
- **MFA (TOTP)** at login + **step-up** for large transfers — the transfer screen handles a
  `step_up_required` 403 by routing to an MFA-verify step, then retrying with the same
  `Idempotency-Key`.

**SSO / OIDC (future, [`06-client-api.md`](06-client-api.md) §6.3):**
- Move customer identity to OAuth2/OIDC (managed IdP or embedded). The Worker runs the
  **authorization-code + PKCE** flow, exchanges the code server-side, and holds tokens in
  httpOnly cookies — the SPA stays a pure relying party.
- API migrates JWT validation from HS256-shared-secret to **RS256/JWKS** (`parseJWT` swaps to a
  key set; `aud=bank0-client` unchanged). Login button becomes "Continue with <IdP>" alongside
  (or replacing) the password form. No ledger/ownership changes — `sub` still maps to `users.id`.

---

## 10. Security model

- SPA talks **only** to its own origin; the Worker proxies to `api.*` (no CORS surface).
- Access token in memory + `sessionStorage`; the path to an httpOnly-cookie BFF is a
  Worker-only change. Tokens never go in `localStorage`.
- The service worker **never** caches `/api/*` (money data); it precaches the shell only.
- CSP/HSTS/nosniff headers from the Worker; HTTPS only.
- Every transfer carries a stable `Idempotency-Key`; retries never double-post.
- `/beneficiaries/resolve` returns the masked owner only, **rate-limited** (enumeration guard).
- Ownership is enforced server-side (`clientSubject` scoping) — the SPA is never trusted.
- Confirm-before-send on transfers; the resolved payee/IBAN is shown at confirm time.

---

## 11. Build & deploy artifacts

The SPA and Worker are built and deployed via the Taskfile:

- **Backend support** — `GET /me` plus the `beneficiaries` schema/functions in
  `db/migrations/`. Confirmation-of-payee `resolve` is hand-written pgx
  (`resolve_account_by_iban()` RETURNS TABLE, which sqlc can't expand).
- **Worker** (`worker/`) — static assets + `/api/*` proxy, `wrangler.toml`, SPA
  fallback, security headers.
- **SPA** (`web/app/`) — Vite + Preact + TS, api client (Bearer + Idempotency-Key +
  error map), signals auth store, the six flows above, and the PWA layer (manifest +
  icon, autoUpdate service worker that precaches the shell and treats `/api/*` as
  network-only). Production build is ~14.5 KB gzipped JS.

Auth hardening (Worker-held refresh cookie + MFA) and SSO/OIDC (Worker PKCE +
RS256/JWKS on the API) are designed extensions — see
[`06-client-api.md`](06-client-api.md) §6 and §9 below.

---

## 12. Design choices

- **Beneficiary self-transfer:** the picker shows the user's own *other* accounts as
  an implicit group and saved payees as another.
- **Confirmation of payee depth:** the masked owner name (initials) is shown at
  resolve time, balancing the privacy/UX trade-off in `resolve_account_by_iban`.
- **Locale/currency:** single currency ([`02`](02-data-model.md)); display locale is
  fixed rather than browser-detected.
- **Token persistence:** `sessionStorage` (clears on tab close), until the BFF cookie
  lands.
- **Offline:** strictly online, given it's a bank — the service worker caches only the
  app shell.
